# Book-Library

Library created with, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
I used sites like AnimateSS, Iconer, UIVerse, CSSGenerator and ChatGPT to get help to make buttons, shadows, animation.

It is a project of the course "The Odin Project". https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library
